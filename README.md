# Regression Analysis of Revenues Prediction Based on Employees Numbers

1.0 PROJECT BACKGROUND

This data science project aims to leverage data science techniques to explore and analyze the relationship between key factors affecting a company’s revenue and its potential for achieving positive revenue growth in the upcoming year, 2023.

The dataset at hand contains valuable information about 600 companies, including their revenue in 2022, employee count, past revenue growth, industry category, and location category.

2.0 OBJECTIVES

The primary objectives of this project are:

1. To Explore the Relationship Between a Company's Emplyee Count and Revenue in 2022
- One of the key questions we aim to answer is whether there is a positive relationship between the number of employees in a company and its revenue in 2022. This analysis can provide insights into how a company’s workforce size correlates with its financial performance. Understanding this relationship can be instrumental for both businesses and investors in making informed decisions.

2. To Predict the Likelihood of Positive Revenue Growth in 2023
- The second objective of this project is to build a predictive model that can assess the likelihood of a company achieving positive revenue growth in the year 2023. This predictive capability can be invaluable for business planning, risk assessment, and investment strategies. By analyzing historical data, we can identify patterns and indicators that contribute to a company’s success in achieving positive revenue growth.

3.0 CONCLUSION

1. To Explore the Relationship Between a Company's Emplyee Count and Revenue in 2022
- Company's employee count have positive relationship to its revenue in 2022 with R2 score=0.2790829 and RMSE = 0.7910687.

2. To Predict the likelihood of Positive Revenue Growth in 2023
- Accuracy of several classification:
  Logistic Regression: 0.5042
  Random Forest: 0.5294
  Naives Bayes: 0.4706

4.0 FUTURE WORK/RECOMMENDATION
1. Explore more variables's relationship with revenue to solve data limitations or the nature of the problem.
2. Possibility to improve the accuracy using essemble machine learning method (multiple model).
